# JoyRide
A personalized web application based on the weather conditions for a specific motorcycle route. Powered by real-time API, the rider will be able to check and plan their route according to the current/predicted weather conditions, points of interests, and create playlists for their ride.

## Description

This code was created to provide an app that helps the user plan a route, note weather conditions & points of interests, and listen to music during their ride. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To plan your route please click create route buttonn. Two inputs will appear for the starting location and destination. While the starting location is not needed it is advised as IpGeolocation API will be close but may not be accurate to current location. Once inputs have been written out, user may submit the data by pressing the Create Route button again. Directions for the planned route will appear on the front page of screen. To rewrite route user can use the same input boxes but may have to press the Create Route Button usually 3 more times but maybe more before function is fully implemented.    

The weather function provides a 5-day forcast to help you determine the best day/days to complete your desired route.

To use the audio player you can click on the Deezer modal and the player will pop up.  All buttons perform their respective functions and the next track on the playlist plays automatically.

This site is responsive for mobile and desktops.
